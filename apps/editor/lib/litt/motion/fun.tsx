// @litt/motion 2026.10.23. What changed: https://littmd.vercel.app/changelog.md

/**
 * Fun mode: a trial, off unless a <FunMode> is on above the components. While it runs, the gallery's Customize panel is
 * where a viewer turns it on (Motion: Calm or Fun), the way the neutrals were split-tested before Stone was locked in.
 *
 * The one rule: fun mode changes how things move, never how they look at rest. A component in fun mode comes to rest
 * on exactly the frame it draws with fun mode off, and with fun mode off it runs the code it always ran. The fun is in
 * three moments:
 * - Arrival: a data part's marks grow to their values in a choreographed wave, and its figures count up with them.
 * - Change: a new value springs from the old one, interruptibly.
 * - Touch: what is under the finger answers it (a press that squishes, a tick that draws, a lens over a heatmap).
 *   Things you hold are physical: a held thumb lifts and stretches with the speed of the finger (useFunGrab), a held
 *   switch stretches toward where it will go, and a thrown thing keeps the speed it was let go at, coasts (coast) and
 *   settles on a step (the throw spring). Past an end it gives like a rubber band (rubber) and comes back.
 *
 * Two honesty rules: a mark may overshoot by a hair, as a physical thing would, but a figure never shows a value the
 * data does not hold, and a count never goes back while a mark settles. And celebration is earned: only a real
 * milestone (a run that went live) gets one, once, small, in the hues already on screen.
 *
 * Reduced motion turns it off, as does StillMotion: useFun() returns null and every component runs as it always has.
 *
 * The springs here go past the locked dial on purpose (the expressive bounce is 0.12); that is the trial. If fun mode
 * is locked in, they move into tokens.css and the rules, through the evolve workflow.
